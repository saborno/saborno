## üìÇ Selected Projects

Here are some of the repositories I‚Äôve worked on. Each one helped me refine specific areas of front-end development and related tech.

| Project | What It Is | What I Learned / Demonstrated |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Flappy Bird Game** | A browser game built with HTML, CSS, JS where you flap to avoid obstacles. | Game logic, collision detection, animation timing, physics emulation. |
| **Object Detection using OpenCV** | Real-time detection & tracking of objects in images or video using OpenCV (Haar cascades / YOLO). | Computer vision basics, working with video/image streams, ML models integration. |
| **College Website Clone** | A replica of a college website, with responsive layout, interactive components. | Layout design, responsiveness, grid/flexbox, attention to UI details. |
| **GNIT Better Web** | Revamped version of the GNIT college site focusing on modern design & user experience. | UI/UX design, CSS styling, polish; pulling design inspirations & putting into practice. |
| **Chess-JS-SCK** | A JavaScript implementation of the classic chess game. | Game logic, data structures, UI state management, event handling. |
| **Bajaj Hackathon** | (Python backend presumably + front-end components) Project from hackathon. | Full-stack exposure, integrating front-end with backend logic, rapid prototyping. |
